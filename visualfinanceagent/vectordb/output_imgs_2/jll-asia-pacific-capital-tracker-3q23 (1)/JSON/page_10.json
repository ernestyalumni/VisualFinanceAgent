{"summary": "APAC was trading sideways up until the release of recession concerns. The fund has since taken a beating, down 20% as a result of this announcement. The average fund has averaged 4.17% for Q2 2023 but has since declined by -28% since. In today's climate, investors remain wary and only those that have a bold allocation towards lower beta funds as opposed to cyclical have retained higher returns in niche sectors. \nIt's important to note that \"YTD\" should be spelled \"year-to-date\" and not \"year total dollars\"."}
