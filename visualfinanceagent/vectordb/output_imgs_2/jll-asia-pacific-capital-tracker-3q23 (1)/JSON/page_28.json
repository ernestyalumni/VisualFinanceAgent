As a result, hotel investment volumes have been impacted in APAC, reaching US$5.5bn in Q2 2023, down by 52% from the same period a year ago. Transaction activity this quarter was mostly active in China, Hong Kong and Korea, all three markets representing 80% of the region's total hotel investment volume."}
