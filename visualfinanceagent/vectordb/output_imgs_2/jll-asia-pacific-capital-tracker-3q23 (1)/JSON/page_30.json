{"summary": "As of September 2023, Singapore's public listed companies boast the highest net asset values (NAV), with a remarkable 20% increase from the 2021 values. Conversely, the unsold public listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have experienced a decline, hovering below their 2021 NAV values by roughly 8%. This divergence in performance is attributed to the direct comparison between office and industrial markets with public REITs that are structured to mitigate the impact of market events."}
